## Chapter 1: Nurture vs. Nature

Dennis believed that his ability to trade was not a natural gift. He looked at the markets as being like Monopoly. He saw strategies, rules, odds, and numbers as objective and learnable. 

In Dennis’s book, everything about the markets was teachable, starting with his very first prerequisite: a proper view of money. He didn’t think about money as merely a means to go buy stuff at the mall, the way most people do. He thought of money as a way to keep score. He could just as easily have used pebbles to keep count. His emotional at tachment to dollars and cents appeared nonexistent.

Dennis would say, in effect, “If I make $5,000, then I can bet more and potentially make $25,000. And if I make $25,000, I can bet that again to get to $250,000. Once there, I can bet even more and get to a million.” He thought in terms of leverage. That was teachable in his book, as well.

“You’re much better off going into the market on a shoestring, feeling that you can’t afford to lose. I’d rather bet on somebody starting out with a few thousand dollars than on somebody who came in with millions.”

Dennis, like Gould, was not about to be taken in by a hereditary interpretation of IQ. His aim was to implant his mental software into the brains of his students, and then place them into his controlled environment to see how they would react and perform.

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There were certain things Dennis was looking for. He wanted students who showed a willingness to take calculated risks. Those who stood out from the herd in some kind of an unconventional way had a leg up. This wasn’t a normal hiring process in the early 1980s, nor would it be normal now. Today, MBA types, for example, are geared to the intellectual rigors of running a company but are reluctant to get their hands dirty. They are the ones who think IQ and connections are all they need. They don’t want to do the hard work. They don’t want to really take a risk.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Dennis didn’t want those people. He was searching for people who enjoyed playing games of chance. He was looking for people who could think in terms of “odds.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Dennis and Eckhardt taught their students everything they needed in only two weeks to trade bonds, currencies, corn, oil, stocks, and all other markets. Their students did not learn to trade from a screaming mosh pit on the trading floor with wild hand signals, but rather in a quiet office with no televisions, computers and only a few phones.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Many of his students went on to make 100 percent or more per year over four years. That’s monster moneymaking. Even more important than those successes from the early 1980s is the current track record of three of the participants. Long after the experiment’s ending, Eckhardt, along with two of Dennis’s former pupils, Jerry Parker and Paul Rabar, manage in excess of $3 billion in 2007.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Investment banks were simply never the career paths of the great entrepreneurial traders. That is why Dennis brings hope. Independent-minded rebel traders, like him, never got to where they were by moving up bureaucratic ladders. They did not bide their time for twenty years engaging in office politics. Dennis and his peers were never part of a<br>Fortune 500 hierarchy. They had one objective: to make absolute-return money trading the markets on their terms. It was high risk and high reward.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Dennis’s Turtle experiment proved, all things being equal, that his students could learn to trade to make millions. However, all things be ing equal, after they learned the “right” trading rules to make those millions, if they did not exhibit, like Boston Red Sox slugger David Ortiz does in baseball, a “walk- off home run” mentality every day, they<br>would fail. Great training alone was not enough to win for the long run. In the end, a persistent drive for winning combined with a healthy dose of courage would be mandatory for Dennis’s students’ long- term survival.</p>

## Chapter 2: Prince of the Pit

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>His moneymaking style was about mammoth home runs and many smaller strikeouts. If there was a “secret,” he knew that you had to be able to accept losses both psychologically and physiologically. Still, 1986 was a long time ago, and memories dull when an old pro starts talking about the benefits of taking “losses.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>You can’t have a standard attitude about money and do well in this business. What do I mean by that? Well, my father, for in stance, worked for the city of Chicago for 30 years, and he once had a job shoveling coal. So, just imagine coming from his frame of reference, and thinking about losing $50 in a few seconds trading commodities. To him, that means another eight hours shoveling coal. That’s a standard attitude about money.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Dennis’s solution allowed him to remain faithful to buying in strength and selling in weakness. He knew that if his system worked in soybeans and corn, then it would also work in gold and stocks and all other markets.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Dennis was famous for those big returns, and that was what his clients wanted—to become rich like Rich. They got on board knowing full well the voyage would get rocky, but conveniently forgot that fact when rough sailing made them seasick. At the first sign of troubled waters, when they were puking losses, they cut short the voyage and blamed Dennis. He was learning the hard way about people’s irrational expectations.</p>

## Chapter 5: The Rules

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Statistical Errors</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Type I Error</strong>: the error of rejecting something that should have been accepted.<br><strong>Type II Error</strong>: the error of accepting something that should have been rejected.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It was better to risk taking many small losses than to risk missing one large profit. The concept of statistical errors was an admission that acknowledged ignorance could be quite beneficial in trading.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Positive Expectation</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Turtle rules themselves had a positive expectation per trade because their winning trades were many multiples larger than their losing trades.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"align":"center"} -->
<p class="has-text-align-center">Expectation = (Win % * Average Win) - (Lose % * Average Lose)</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Entries and Exits</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If a stock or futures contract made a 55-day breakout to the upside (long), meaning that its current price was the highest price of the last 55 days, Turtles would buy. If a stock made a 55-day breakout to the downside, meaning that its current price was the lowest price of the last 55 days, Turtles would sell short, aiming to profit as the market dropped.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Two Turtle Systems: System One and System Two</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>System One</strong> uses a four-week price breakout for entry and a two-week price breakout in the opposite direction of the entry breakout for an exit. If a market made a new four-week high, the Turtles would buy. They would exit if/when it made a two-week low. A two-week low was a ten-day breakout-counting trading days only.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>System Two</strong> was the Turtles’ longer-term trading system. It used an eleven-week breakout (55 days) for an entry signal and a four-week breakout (20 days) in the opposite direction for an exit.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3 class="wp-block-heading">No Need to Fixate Certain Values of Parameters</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It is not surprising that over the years some traders—those who knew the Turtle rules—became obsessed with the specific System One and System Two entry and exit values as if they were the long- lost Holy Grail. <strong>Traders who fixate like that are looking at the tree instead of seeing the whole forest.</strong> For Turtle trading to work, the simplest of entry rules must continue to work. To get into debates about whether entering on a fi fty- day breakout or a fi fty- one-day breakout is better is misguided. In reality, a minor change of a variable in any robust trading system should not cause significant performance changes. If it does, you are in trouble.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The core simple moving average or breakout systems are key. I think making our parameters longer term is important, but the minute it takes too much thinking and too much analysis and too much fancy work, it is going to be a very bad situation.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Random Entries</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eckhardt witnessed many systematic traders spending great deal of time searching for the “good” places to enter. He cautioned against it: “It just seems to be part of human nature to focus on the most hopeful point of the trading cycle. <strong>Our research indicated that liquidations are vastly more important than initiations.</strong> If you initiate purely randomly,<br>you do surprisingly well with a good liquidation criterion.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"align":"center"} -->
<p class="has-text-align-center">Stop worrying only about how you enter a trade. The key is to know at all times when you will exit.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Risk Management: ATR and Position Sizing</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Turtle risk management starts with the measurement of daily market volatility. The Turtles were taught to measure volatility in terms of “daily ranges.” It was nicknamed “N” (also known as the Average True Range, or ATR).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Once they had a feel for “N,” the Turtles were instructed about how much to “bet.” They bet a fixed 2 percent of their capital on hand on each trade. If they had $100,000, they would bet (or risk) 2 percent ($2,000) on each trade. Each 2 percent bet of their equity was called a “unit.” The “unit” was jargon that they used every day to measure risk.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Turtle risk management dictated their stops, their additions to positions, and their equalization of risk across their portfolios.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Assuming a $100,000 account, they would have had an “account risk” of $2,000 (2% X $100,000). The number of contracts to buy or sell is determined by taking the 2 percent account risk and dividing it by the contract risk. That gives 2.67 ($2,000/$700) futures contracts. Turtles rounded down to the nearest whole number.</p>

<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Assume you are trading Google stock and its ATR is 20. A 2ATR (2N) stop would be 40. If you lose 40 points on Google, you must exit, no questions asked.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Jerry Parker found that his best trends often start with very low volatility at the initial breakout entries. He said, “If the recent volatility is very low, not $5 in gold, but $2.50 in gold, then we’re going to throw in a very large position.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Examples of Risk Determination</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>1. Assume a trading account of $150,000, risking 1.5 percent on each trade and seeking to trade Swiss franc futures using a 2N stop. The Swiss franc has a single “N” dollar value of $800.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>$150,000 &nbsp;X 1.50% = &nbsp;$2,250</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>2N stop = &nbsp;$1,600</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>The number of contracts to trade on this unit is 1.40, rounded down to 1.0.</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>2. Assume a trading account of $25,000, risking 2.0 percent on each trade and seeking to trade mini corn futures using a 3N stop. Mini corn has a single “N” dollar value of $70.00.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>$25,000 &nbsp;X 2.0% =&nbsp;$500</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>3N stop =&nbsp;$210 </li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>The number of contracts to trade on this unit is 2.38, rounded down to 2.0.&nbsp;</li>
<!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Pyramiding: Adding to Winners</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This maxing out of their big winners was part of what helped to create the Turtles’ fantastic positive expectancy, or “edge.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>For example, a market bought at a price breakout level of 100 could have additional units added as the market moved through price levels of 102, 104, and 108. <strong>Assume a long breakout entry at 100 with an “N” value of 5. Assume that you will add another unit each 1N move. A new unit will be added at 105, 110, etc.</strong> Turtles could pyramid a maximum of 5 units. They set their stops at 1⁄2N on the first day of trading and from that point forward, 2N stops were used. Then, once the second unit was bought, both stops were brought up to the new unit’s 2N stop. As new units were added, all stops were brought up to the stop of the newest unit added.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Risk of Ruin</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>How did Eckhardt teach the Turtles to handle losing streaks and protect capital? <strong>They cut back their unit sizes dramatically.</strong> When markets turned around, this preventive behavior of reducing units increased the likelihood of a quick recovery, getting back to making big money again. <strong>The rules were simple. For every 10 percent in drawdown in their account, Turtles cut their trading unit risk by 20 percent.</strong> When did they increase their unit sizes back to normal? Once their capital started going back up.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Summary of Liquidation (Exit) Rules</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There were two basic “stops” or exits to get Turtles out of their trades: The 2N stop and The S1 or S2 breakout exits. The Turtles were instructed to take whichever stop hit first.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Portfolio Correlation</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It was critical to avoid having one of highly correlated markets. In simple terms, think of correlated markets typically moving together in lockstep. Too many potentially correlated markets in a portfolio and the Turtles increased their unit risk.</p>
