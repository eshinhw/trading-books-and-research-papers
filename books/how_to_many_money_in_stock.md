# How to Make Money in Stocks

## Chapter 1

As a general guide for new or experienced investors, I would suggest you not buy any stock that doesn't show earnings per share up at least 18% or 20% in the most recent quarter versus the same quarter the year before. Many successful money-makers use 25% or 30% as their minimum earnings parameter. And make sure you calculate the percentage change; don't guess or assume. You will be even safer if you insist the last two quarters each show a significant percentage increase in earnings from year-ago quarters.

- Invest in stocks which have accelerating quarterly earnings growth.
- Two quarters of major earnings deceleration may mean trouble.
- Compare a stock's percentage increase in earnings for the quarter ended December, to the December quarter a year earlier. Never compare the December quarter to the immediately prior September quarter.

## Chapter 2

- Select stocks with 25% to 50% annual growth rates.
- The stability of a company's five-year earnings record is also important.

## Chapter 9

In the stock market, you absolutely can't win either unless you have a strong predetermined defense to protect yourself against large losses. This may surprise you, but if you invest in stocks, you are going to make a never ending number of mistakes in your selection and timing of purchases. These poor decisions will lead to losses, some of which can become quite awful. No matter how smart you may think you are or how good you believe your information or analysis is, you simply are not going to be right all of the time. In fact, you will probably be right only half the time!

The whole secret to winning in the stock market is to lose the least amount possible when you're not right.  

## Chapter 11: Should You Diversify, Invest for the Long Pull, Buy on Margin, Sell Short?

The more you diversify, the less you know about any one area. Many investors overdiversify. The best results are achieved through concentration: putting all your eggs in just a few baskets that you know a great deal about and continuing to watch those baskets very carefully.

### Do Not Day Trade
One type of stock trading you definitely do not want to engage in is day trading, or day-to-day trading, where you try to buy and sell a stock on the same day. The reason is simple. You are dealing with minor daily fluctuations which are much harder to determine than are basic trends.

There is not enough profit potential in daily trading to offset the commissions you generate and the inevitable losses that occur. As men- tioned before, you also should not follow a program of taking short, two-point profits, because again your margin of profit is too small to off- set larger losses, which in time must happen. Don't try to make money so fast. You can't build Rome in a day.

### Should You Use Margin?

In the first year or two while an investor is learning, it is much safer to restrict activities to a cash basis. However, with a few years' experience, a sound plan, and a set of rules, you could consider buying on margin (using borrowed money from your stockbrokerage firm), particularly if you are young and still working.

The best time to use margin is usually during the first two years of a new bull market. Once you recognize a new bear market, you should get off margin immediately and raise as much cash as possible. If you are unquestionably active and more seasoned, you may consider limited short selling.

## Chapter 12: Should You Buy Options, OTC Stocks, New Issues...?

I do not think most investors should buy or sell options. Options are very speculative and involve substantially greater risks and price volatility than do common stocks. Winning investors should first learn how to minimize the investment risks they take, not increase them.

### Should You Write Options?

Writing options is a completely different story from buying options. I am not overly impressed with the strategy of writing options on stocks.

What happens if the stock doubles? The writer gets the stock called away, and for a scrubby fee loses all chance for a worthwhile profit. Why take risks in stocks for only skimpy gains and no chance for large gains? The reasoning I'm giving you is not the reasoning you will hear from most investors or brokers. But then again, what most people are saying and doing in the stock market isn't worth knowing, is it?

### Are Income Stocks Recommended?

I do not believe most people should buy common stocks for dividends or income. In theory, income stocks should be safer, but don't be lulled into believing they can't decline sharply.

If you do buy income stocks, don't strain to buy the highest dividend yield available. That will probably entail greater risk and lower quality. Trying to get an extra 2% or 3% yield can expose your capital to larger losses. Dividends can also be cut if they are not being adequately cov- ered by a company's earnings per share.

If you need income, my advice is to buy the very best stocks you can find and simply withdraw 6% or 7% of your investment each year for liv- ing expenses. You could sell off a few shares and withdraw lV2% per quarter. Higher rates of withdrawal are not generally advisable, since in time they could lead to possible depletion of your principal.

### Should You Buy Foreign Stocks?

How about foreign stocks? Don't they have terrific potential? Yes, a few foreign stocks have great potential at the right time and the right place, but I don't advise individual investors to waste much time investing in foreign stocks. The potential profit should be two or three times as large as that in a standout U.S. company to justify the additional risk of owning a foreign stock.

It is not really necessary for individuals to find foreign stocks when there are over 8000 securities to select from in the United States. Foreign stocks should probably be left to professionals who specialize in this field. There are a few good mutual funds that excel in this specialty.

### Do You Belong in Futures?

Should you speculate in commodities or other futures? Probably not. Commodity futures are extremely volatile and much more speculative than most common stocks are. It is not an arena for the inexperienced or small investor unless you want to gamble or lose money quickly.
However, once an investor has four or five years' experience and has unquestionably proven his or her ability to make money in common stocks, the "strong of heart" might consider this medium.
