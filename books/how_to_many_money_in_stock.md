# How to Make Money in Stocks

## Chapter 1

As a general guide for new or experienced investors, I would suggest you not buy any stock that doesn't show earnings per share up at least 18% or 20% in the most recent quarter versus the same quarter the year before. Many successful money-makers use 25% or 30% as their minimum earnings parameter. And make sure you calculate the percentage change; don't guess or assume. You will be even safer if you insist the last two quarters each show a significant percentage increase in earnings from year-ago quarters.

- Invest in stocks which have accelerating quarterly earnings growth.
- Two quarters of major earnings deceleration may mean trouble.
- Compare a stock's percentage increase in earnings for the quarter ended December, to the December quarter a year earlier. Never compare the December quarter to the immediately prior September quarter.

## Chapter 2

- Select stocks with 25% to 50% annual growth rates.
- The stability of a company's five-year earnings record is also important.
