## Chapter 1

As a general guide for new or experienced investors, I would suggest you not buy any stock that doesn't show earnings per share up at least 18% or 20% in the most recent quarter versus the same quarter the year before. Many successful money-makers use 25% or 30% as their minimum earnings parameter. And make sure you calculate the percentage change; don't guess or assume. You will be even safer if you insist the last two quarters each show a significant percentage increase in earnings from year-ago quarters.

- Invest in stocks which have accelerating quarterly earnings growth.
- Two quarters of major earnings deceleration may mean trouble.
- Compare a stock's percentage increase in earnings for the quarter ended December, to the December quarter a year earlier. Never compare the December quarter to the immediately prior September quarter.

## Chapter 2

- Select stocks with 25% to 50% annual growth rates.
- The stability of a company's five-year earnings record is also important.

## Chapter 9

In the stock market, you absolutely can't win either unless you have a strong predetermined defense to protect yourself against large losses. This may surprise you, but if you invest in stocks, you are going to make a never ending number of mistakes in your selection and timing of purchases. These poor decisions will lead to losses, some of which can become quite awful. No matter how smart you may think you are or how good you believe your information or analysis is, you simply are not going to be right all of the time. In fact, you will probably be right only half the time!
